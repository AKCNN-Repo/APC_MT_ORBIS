# Deep Learning Approach for Automated Monitoring of Crystallization Processes
# Overview 
This repository contains the base data generated by the Deep Learning for Automated Monitoring of Crystallization Processes.
# Train/Validation/Test Data 
The base dataset is compiled from the 800 annotated images of mannitol and sucrose crystals, droplets and bubbles, from Cyclohexane and their accompanying configuration file. 
This dataset was divided into training and testing subsets in a 9:1 ratio, resulting in 1,335 training instances.
